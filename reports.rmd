## Introduction
This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obatain from FBI report

First we are going to use the following library :
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

then, we load data we already wrangled :
```{r}
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

we start by generate summary of the data by using sumary() function. Here is the result :
```{r murders}
summary(murders)
```

## Murder rate by state

We visualize murder by state data

```{r plot_murders, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, stat= "identity", color='black') +
  coord_flip()
```
